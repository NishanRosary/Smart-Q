# \# Smart’Q – Smart Queue Management System with Live Crowd Prediction

# 

# Smart’Q is a web-based Smart Queue Management System designed to modernize traditional queue handling in service environments such as hospitals, banks, restaurants, and government offices.  

# Unlike basic token systems, Smart’Q provides \*\*real-time queue updates, digital queue joining, and crowd-level insights\*\*, reducing physical congestion and improving service efficiency.

#

# 

# \## 📌 Problem Statement

# 

# Traditional queue systems rely on physical waiting lines and manual token handling, leading to overcrowding, inefficient service flow, and poor customer experience.  

# Most existing digital queue systems offer only static token generation without real-time updates or crowd insights.

# 

# Smart’Q addresses these limitations by introducing a \*\*dynamic, auto-updating queue system\*\* with separate customer and admin interfaces.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🎯 Objectives

# 

# \- Eliminate physical queues through a digital queue management system  

# \- Allow customers to join queues via login or QR code scanning  

# \- Provide real-time queue position updates without page refresh  

# \- Estimate waiting time based on live and historical data  

# \- Enable administrators to manage queues and counters efficiently  

# \- Reduce overcrowding and improve overall service experience  

# \- Design a scalable system suitable for multi-branch deployment

# 

# \## 🧠 System Overview

# 

# \### Customer Module

# \- Join the queue digitally or via QR code

# \- View live queue position updates

# \- Track estimated waiting time

# \- Access the system from any mobile or desktop browser

# 

# \### Admin Module

# \- Monitor active queues in real time

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

# 

# Smart’Q follows a \*\*full-stack, REST-based architecture\*\*:

# 

# \- \*\*Frontend\*\* handles user interaction and visualization

# \- \*\*Backend\*\* manages business logic and APIs

# \- \*\*Database\*\* stores queue data, event data, and history

# 

# Real-time behaviour is simulated through frequent data synchronization between frontend and backend.
